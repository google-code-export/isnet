the importance of online privacy. The following Policy outlines how we do
business, what information we collect and how, under what circumstances the information
is shared with third parties, and your options to control what communications

How It Is Used</b><br>
In order to participate in this Islamic mentor-protégé network, you must first
complete the registration information requested. We ask for an email address so
that we can deliver your contact information to a certified <span class="GramE">muslim</span>
mentor and so we may contact you if necessary. We ask for a mailing address so
we know where to ship the products that you may have purchased pertaining to training.
We ask for a phone number if you wish to be contacted by phone. The system
allows you to block both your email and phone number from others on the site,
should you choose to do so.</p>

<p>Registering for this network automatically subscribes you to the MyC2I.com
newsletter, a periodic email communicating <span class="GramE">various news</span>
and updates that we think you might like based on the registration information
you provided. Users may unsubscribe from this newsletter <span class="GramE"><span class="grame">an any</span></span> time by clicking on the automated link provided
on the registration or personal information page.</p>

is developing. We request your address and phone number for shipping purposes
